User speech
  -> ASR (SpeechRecognition + Microphone)
  -> Text
  -> Agent (LLM or rule-based) + Memory
  -> Reply text
  -> Murf Falcon TTS (low-latency voice synthesis)
  -> Audio playback (Streamlit st.audio)

Modularity:
- Swap ASR: Python mic (now) -> Falcon ASR (future)
- Swap Reply: rule-based (now) -> LLM (OpenAI) with memory (now)
- Swap TTS: Falcon synchronous (now) -> Falcon streaming (future)
